# Loginformandmovieslist-UI
Q.2  . Create a simple login form where a user can sign in and then there should be one page where user can rate as well as put comments on the movies (you can make list of any 10 movies). The average rating and comments should be visible besides the movie name.
 you can use Angular, HTML, CSS and JS to create this page. For Backend you can use ASP .net MVC or Node.js.
Data storage can be done in JSON file (Be Creative with UI) or you can use any Database (SQL, MongoDB, etc).

Explaination:

all files are in master
ass1.html page and aas1.css  and ass1.js file has the login form and netflix1 image is used
dumyass1p2.html file which shows the list of movies to user and lightslider-master folder is connected to it for performing sliding of movie images 
Further the dumyass1p2.html file is connected to realtime-comment folder's index.html page in next link given by me.
